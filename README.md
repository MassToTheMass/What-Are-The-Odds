Hayden Hooper 801-577-8007

## Purpose of Program
To play a what are the odds dare game with your friends with no way to cheat. 

## How to Run
run ./a.out and then press 1 to play you then select the difficulty of dare, the higher the difficulty the worse the dare but also the slimmer the odds of you having to do it. Then you choose a number between 1 and the number of the difficulty and if the computers randomly generated number is the same as the one you chose then you have to do the dare. Then you can do it again and have your friends do it too.

## Working/not working
Everything is working but we did not reach the point we wanted to because the tests and CE work was quite difficult we did not get to work on the project a whole ton, however we did implement data bases that allow users to add dares and other things to the code but  we never got to the point of allowing the user to actually use these functions as they are not done and not amazing either. That was the main struggle was creating someone online so people can realtime alter and add dares/post videos which we never really figured out.
